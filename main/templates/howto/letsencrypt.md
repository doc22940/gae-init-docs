[Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free, automated, and open certificate authority by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), that can provide SSL/TLS certificates. Here is how you can integrate it and use it with **gae-init**:

Use the [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-shell/docs/) to execute the following docker commands:

```bash
docker run -it -p 443:443 -p 80:80 \
  -v "$(pwd)/ssl-keys:/etc/letsencrypt" \
  quay.io/letsencrypt/letsencrypt:latest \
  -a manual certonly
```

After following the instructions, filling the URL and email for the custom domain, you should get the **challenge** and the **response** back. Copy/paste them into the **Admin > SSL** section of the deployed app.

Before uploading the certificates to App Engine, convert the private key to a compatible format (replace `www.example.com` with your actual domain):

```bash
sudo openssl rsa -inform pem \
  -in ~/ssl-keys/live/www.example.com/privkey.pem \
  -outform pem > ~/ssl-keys/live/www.example.com/privkey_fixed.pem
```

Copy the contents of `cert.pem` & `privkey_fixed.pem` into the App Engine settings for [SSL Certificats](https://console.developers.google.com/appengine/settings/certificates):

```bash
sudo cat ~/ssl-keys/live/www.example.com/cert.pem
sudo cat ~/ssl-keys/live/www.example.com/privkey_fixed.pem
```

Set up the custom domain and make sure that you have `secure: always` in your [`app.yaml`](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/blob/master/main/app.yaml#L49).
