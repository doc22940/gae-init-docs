To install or upgrade pip, securely download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). Then run the following (which may require administrator access):

```bash
$ python get-pip.py
```

After the installation make sure that you are able to run the `pip --version` command from your terminal.
