If you need more fine-grained control over who can access what, you can use the `@auth.permission_required(permission)` decorator. It will only allow accesses to the decorated function by registered users who were given that permission (or admins). It works like this:

```python
@app.route('/moderate')
@auth.permission_required('moderator')
def moderate():
  return flask.render_template(...)
```

This will automagically register `'moderator'` as an available permission which an admin can assign to individual users via the user list. For convenience you can leave the `permission` string empty, which will cause the permission to be named as the decorated function (so `@auth.permission_required()` would introduce and check for the permission `'moderate'` in the example above).

If `methods` is specified, the decorator will only enforce the given permission for requests with a method as in `methods` (e.g., `@auth.permission_required('foo_w', methods=['POST'])` will only check the user for permission `'foo_w'` in POST requests but won't restrict other requests). If `methods` is `None` (default), the permissions will be enforced on all requests regardless of their method.

Several uses of this decorator can be combined as in the example below. This only allows access to `endpoint` in GET requests if the user has `'foo_r'` permission. For POST requests the user needs both `'foo_r'` and `'foo_w'`:

```python
@app.route('/endpoint/')
@auth.permission_required('foo_r')
@auth.permission_required('foo_w', methods=['POST'])
def endpoint():
  pass
```

Typical usecases:

* allow everyone to read, restrict write to a few users: just leave out the second line
* allow all logged in users to read, restrict write to a few users: replace the second line with `@auth.login_required`

The order of the statements is not important as the permissions are wrapped around each other. All of the permission guards have to be passed in order to reach `endpoint`. Passing one of them does **not** skip the others.
