Sends an email notification to the feedback email if it set in the admin config settings. The email is sent as a background task, using the [deferred](https://developers.google.com/appengine/articles/deferred) library, to avoid possible errors that could be produced due to quota limits or anything else. The brand name of the application will be used as a name of the sender and prefixed to the `subject` of the email.
