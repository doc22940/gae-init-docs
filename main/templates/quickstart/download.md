1. Clone the gae-init sample app to your local machine (from the GitHub repository):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init.git hello
   ```

2. Go into the directory that now contains the sample app code:

   ```
   cd hello
   ```

3. Install the third party dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

Alternatively, you can [download the project](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/archive/master.zip) as a zip file and extract it into a directory named `hello`.
